<p class="text">What is Bioaccumulation?
    Bioaccumulation is the process by which harmful substances, such as pollutants or toxins, accumulate in the tissues of living organisms over time</p>
<p class="text">This phenomenon occurs when the rate of intake of a substance is greater than the organism's ability to excrete or metabolize it.</p>
<p class="text">This can have serious consequences for both individual organisms and entire ecosystems, as it can lead to the magnification of harmful substances up the food chain.</p>
